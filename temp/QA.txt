Why testing is necessary?
-to identify the defects
-to reduce flaws in the component or system
-increase overall quality of the system
-evaluating the ease of the use of the software
-imp(software test help acclerate developement)

Testing VS Debugging

QA is typically focused on adherence to proper, in order to provide confidience that the approprate levels of quality will be achieved.

Testing Types
-White-box Testing
-Black-box Testing

# White-box Testing: test based on the system's internal structure or implementation
--Unit Testing
--Testing for memory Leaks
--Penetration Testing
--Path Testing

# Black-box Testing: a tester doesnot have any info about the internal working of the software system focuses on behaviour of software
--Functional Testing: Unit, Smoke, API, Regression, Component, Sanity, Integration, UI Testing(Imp: Sanity, Smoke, Regression for QA interns)
--Non-functional Testing: Performance, Security, Stress, Load Volume, Recovery ,Upgrade and Installation Tests
--Regression Testing

# Change-related Testing: is designed to verify that a change to systm has been formed correctly and foesnot have any advece effects on the system as a consequence
Types:
        -Functional Testing
        -Smoke Testing
        -Regression Testing
        -Build Verification Testing
        -Sanity Testing

# Testing Techniques: A protocol to design a better test cases and shape a proper testing workflow.
White-box Testing:
        -Statement Coverage(Sabai ek na ke chotintest vako huna parcha)
        -Decision Coverage(if else ma check garni)
        -Multiple Concilation Coverage(Condition Check garni a=b or/and a=c)
        -Control Flow Testing(application ko flow kasari lagni according to requirement and tei aanusar test case haru design garni)
        -Data Flow Testing(data haru test ma kasari manage garni eg: age ma -1 halni)
        **yeti matra huadina aaruni huncha mainly chai yo use vaira huncha**

Black-box Testing:
        -Equivalance Class Testing(eg 1000 ota test case di jana le execute garda 2weeks lagcha so teslai milauni aani kaam banauni)
        -Boundary Value Testing(eg age 0-150 huncha ni ta integer haru -11111 to +11112 huncha so age ko lagi specific range set gardini)
        -Decision Table Testing(eg hamro each requirement ra each test case map garni ho jasle garda requiremnt ra testcase miss nahos)
        **yeti matra huadina aaruni huncha mainly chai yo use vaira huncha**

Experienced-based Test Techniques
        proper testing flow aanusar nagai out of the box afno knowledge aanusar test garni

        -Error Guessing(eg kasto error ka huna sakcah guess garera test garni , k huna sakcha ta possible scenario in an application)
        -Explotary Testing/Monkey Testing(eg j maanlaggyo tei explore garera test garni login garda double click garera test garni k huncha vhanera badar ko jasto)
        -Checklist-based Testing(eg hami sanga set of test case huncha eg 1000, userko requirement aanusar sabai check nagari chaini chaini testcase banayera tei aanusar check garni)

# Test Plan: is a detail document ho jun ma test ko process, test kosley garni kaile garni mention garera detail plan gareko huncha.
It should include:
        -Analyze the product
        -Design test strategy
        -Define test objectives
        -Plan test environment
        -Resource planning
        -Define test creteria
        -Schedule estimation
        -Determine test deliverables

# Test Scope:

# Test Approach:

# Test Tool:

# Risk & Mitigation:

# Test Analysis: hamro yo project ma kasto kasto scenario aaucha vhanera analysis garni ho. Goal is to gather requirements and define the goal objectives.

# Test Management: consists of organizing , controlling, ensuring the visibility of testing process. It consists of series of activities.

# Requirement Traceability Matrix(RTM): requirement ko lagi test case xuttauni eg: reqd no1 ko lagi test case 2 7 9 lai tick garni paci test garna

# Test Scenario: It is a collective set of test case which helps testing team to determine positive and negative charactertics of a project.

# Test Case: is a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality fo your software application.

# Test Organization
	#Test Estimation:determine how long and how much the testing cost.
		it estimates: resource, time, human skill, cost 
	#how to estimate?

	#risk analysis: test garda garda server down vayo.
